        Instead of an easel - a tripod. Instead of brushes - a camera that
        transmits feelings and emotions in one shot. And one day opening the
        album, reviewing pictures in the minds memories begin to emerge, the
        same emotions that had been on the day of the shooting. And by the will
        of a smile appears on the face, and maybe even tears, tears of joy.And
        you realize that there is something to show our grandchildren proudly
        saying, "It is Me" This site is a small part of my work, I want to show
        you. With each pair, with every man, I have shot, watching their
        emotions, feelings - I was feeling the same and tried to show these
        feelings in the photos.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-500">
        That is how I see this world. Enjoy watching
